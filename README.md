# README and VIDEO

Users are divided into two classes, attendee and organisers. It is designed such that all organisers must register as an attendee first, so that every organiser must also be attendees. There is a button on the navigation bar to switch between attendee' page and organiser's page of the same account. This is to allow organisers to preview how attendee's interface would look like without creating another attendee account.

Extra features:
Apart from the basic requirements,

There are security checks when registering a new account, and also when deleting an event and promoting an user, organisers will need to re-verify their password.
In terms of security, all inputs are escaped and some symbols such as < > & " ' are not allowed when creating a new username.

Organisers are able to send new messages to either a specific user, all organisers and attendees, and all organisers. The notification would be displayed on every page which requires log in.

Also, there are theme colours of the webpage so that organisers can know whether they are in attendee's account or organiser's account easily.
There is a footer in the bottom of every page to provide users contact details.

Before submitting your coursework, run `./clean.sh` as this will remove the virtual environment which can be reconstructed locally.
